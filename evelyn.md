Hi, I'm Evelyn Yang, and I'm a second-year computer science major! I like listening to music and watching movies.

I liked the ideas that were suggested in class! We could maybe also add a feature that suggests music to a user based on other users with similar music tastes, as well as a feature that allows users to analyze their listening behavior over a certain period of time.
