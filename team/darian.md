Hello, I'm Darian Sung and I am a second year computer science major
at UCSB. My hobbies include playing guitar and watching bad movies.

This program will be able to take in two Spotify playlists and determine
compatibility by their similarities. It will identify same songs, 
same artists, same genres, and other possible criteria. Using these metrics,
we can produce some percentage of compatibility between two Spotify users
via their playlists.
