Hi, I'm Spencer Zou! I'm a second year CS major. My hobbies include eating, clothes, and soccer.

I'm working on the Spotify compatibility app.
I think we can use the genre data on Spotify songs in order to create a percentage of match between two playlists.
In addition, we can also analyze matching songs or artists, which will weigh more heavily on the matching percentage.
We can then use java to implement this into a webapp.
